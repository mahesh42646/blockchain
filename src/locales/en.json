      "faq1A": "Yes. Blockchain.com will respond to valid law enforcement agency information requests. See above for instructions. Note that the most helpful pieces of information you can provide are a wallet identifier (e.g. 2td3t671-c54d-ds32-456t-65ftya3b24dd) or Exchange account details. Other data points, like a bitcoin address (e.g. 14eK8q8GXubF2Y9yegRyfpkVm63AsFcefb) or a transaction number (e.g. c1a3cec06316fb13bd0198afc8b15e6edc5123fc5d15383446cc9f3b43ca0734), are significantly less likely to return helpful information.",
      "faq2Q": "I can see, using Blockchain.com's Block Explorer, that a transaction took place on the Bitcoin (or some other) blockchain. Does this necessarily mean that Blockchain.com's products or services were responsible for the transaction?",
      "faq2A": "No. Our Block Explorer displays information from public network ledgers. Blockchain.com publishes all of its transactions on these public ledgers, but it is only one of thousands of software products and services doing so.",
      "faq3Q": "I have a bitcoin address or transaction hash. Can Blockchain.com correlate this information with any personally identifying user information?",
      "faq3A": "If the user simply downloaded and used Blockchain.com's non-custodial wallet, no. But if the address or hash was used in a Swap or Exchange transaction, then Blockchain Access can correlate it to the user's profile. Note, however, that Swap transactions are non-custodial. Thus, a user's Swap transaction does not link the user in Blockchain.com's records to other transactions made in the user's non-custodial wallet.",
      "faq4Q": "I have the name, address, telephone number, or other identifying information of an individual. Can Blockchain.com correlate this information with other personally identifying information?",
      "faq4A": "As in the answer above: If the individual is only a non-custodial wallet user, Blockchain.com is unlikely to have such information. If the individual is a user of Swap or the Exchange, Blockchain.com may be able to correlate the information with a user profile.",
      "faq5Q": "I have the private key or backup phrase associated with a bitcoin address. What information can Blockchain.com correlate to these data points?",
      "faq5A": "None. Blockchain.com does not know private keys or backup phrases associated with any user wallets.",
      "faq6Q": "I have a non-custodial wallet identifier. Can Blockchain.com freeze or deliver virtual currency from that wallet?",
      "faq6A": "No, Blockchain.com cannot access user's wallets. Blockchain.com can, however, deliver certain industry-standard log information associated with the wallet, including creation date, login time, device ID, operating system, associated email address or telephone numbers (if used for 2-factor ID), together with any encrypted wallet file backed up using Blockchain.com's servers."
